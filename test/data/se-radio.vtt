shines at the university of nevada las
vegas andreas has been working on

8
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.130
creating technologies that make it
easier for people including those with

9
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.710
disabilities to write computer software
he helped establish the first national

10
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.250
educational infrastructure for blind or
visually impaired students to learn

computer shines education welcome to

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.380
the show under yes thanks and thanks
for inviting me so this show is about

15
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.470
how blind and visually impaired people
interact with sulfur but first let's

16
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.660
start with the basics how many blind or
visually impaired people are there in

17
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.280
the world what should we take into
account when designing so far for them

18
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.890
it's about one point three million
people ball park and one in the us and

19
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.820
that's a lot of people it's enough to
at least make a dent on any kind of

20
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.370
mark to market you could sell for so
help us understand how blind people

21
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.480
using computer because most people that
listen to the show probably are sighted

22
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.600
outside it is how we call people like
that khun c and they're used to using

23
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.860
the mouse looking at the screen what do
blind and visually officially empower

24
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.560
people do there's a variety of things
that they do many people that are blind

25
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.490
or visually impaired have partial
vision or sometimes called functional

26
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.370
vision depending on what it is and
usually that means they can see some

27
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.690
things or they can see color or they
can see some amount of light depending

28
00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.300
upon the person. So in those cases you
might use technologies like screen

29
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.380
magnifier zor you might use literally a
magnifying glass for other types of

30
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.630
things if you are non sighted meaning
you have no sight at all or you have no

31
00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.810
vision that's effectively functional
than a more typical devices either

32
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.020
braille or a screen reader probably the
most common is screen reader

33
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.620
technologies and basically what it
means is that the computer translates

34
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.200
what's on the screen into speech can
you give us a nim precious in for how

35
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.920
that would look like so if if a screen
reader listens to or looks at the web

36
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.900
page how does that some slash luke yeah,
i'll turn it on

sixteen lead content you are currently
on web content to enter the wet area

press control option shift down arrow
that particular screenwriters called

40
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.010
voiceover it's the screening option
happens to be on mac on windows there's

41
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.080
a bunch of them there's one called
nvidia, which is free there's one

42
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.610
that's made by a company called freedom
scientific called jaws pretty popular

43
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.260
but quite quite expensive and windows
has one built in a cz well that's been

44
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.750
improving over the last few years, so
when we listen to it it's not only

45
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.110
reading the text on the web site it can
also navigate the website and give us

46
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.040
information on where you are it said
something like you are now x yeah

47
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.020
that's good so there's a funny thing so
academics often talk about this with a

48
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.990
certain term they call it the wear at
my problem i think the person that

49
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.760
defined that was ah a woman by the name
of excuse me, joan friend francioni or

50
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.270
frankie and i'm not sure i've never met
her actually, but in any case, the idea

51
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.430
is pretty simple it's that the screen
reader ties to give you both a sense of

52
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.990
the content and a sense of like where
you are on the page like the semantics

53
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.730
of web page like i'm in a heading or
i'm in a paragraph or i'm on a level

54
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.560
two heading stuff like that yeah,
because not only consuming the text is

55
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.640
a problem navigating is also a big
problem i've understood right? Yeah

56
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.792
yes, the navigation parts of it are
probably the most crucial because think

57
00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:07.882
about it like this if i gave you a long
website and i just read the text

58
00:04:07.882 --> 00:04:11.522
linearly it would be pretty hard to
understand because won't be very long

59
00:04:11.912 --> 00:04:15.582
and if you can navigate a web page,
then you khun selectively determine

60
00:04:15.582 --> 00:04:19.982
what information toe understand when
and that makes it a lot easier. So so

61
00:04:19.982 --> 00:04:23.582
far we thought about websites and
navigation but of course there's also

62
00:04:23.592 --> 00:04:29.482
acts and programs do they also work
with build in screen reader? Are you ap

63
00:04:29.492 --> 00:04:33.272
and program developers have to do
something special? It's complicated

64
00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:38.972
unfortunately so on the webs on the web
there's a number of rather excellent

65
00:04:38.972 --> 00:04:43.972
standards for accessibility in part
just because the webs used a lot s o to

66
00:04:43.972 --> 00:04:49.012
give your listeners on example one is
called aria aria is basically a way

67
00:04:49.012 --> 00:04:51.892
that you could do interactive web sites
is sort of the type of thing if you

68
00:04:51.892 --> 00:04:56.222
wanted like an interactive facebook or
something to be blind, accessible apse

69
00:04:56.222 --> 00:05:00.692
khun definitely be accessible as well,
but how they're accessible varies by

70
00:05:00.702 --> 00:05:05.262
platform and is actually one of the
sort of pain points. For example, if i

71
00:05:05.262 --> 00:05:09.982
want to make my app from apple
accessible there's certain happily type

72
00:05:09.982 --> 00:05:14.802
things that i have to do and they're
kind of tricky and android has its own

73
00:05:14.802 --> 00:05:18.822
platform with its own languages and
ecosystem on top of that, if you're

74
00:05:18.822 --> 00:05:23.412
using apse on something like a tablet
or phone they have different screen

75
00:05:23.412 --> 00:05:27.622
reader technologies so apple has voice
over which i think most people credit a

76
00:05:27.622 --> 00:05:32.622
scholar named sean kane for inventing
sort of like really cool gestures that

77
00:05:32.622 --> 00:05:36.592
you use specifically for blind
individuals on dh android sort of has

78
00:05:36.592 --> 00:05:40.852
those too but they kind of have weird
variations and are complicated can we

79
00:05:40.852 --> 00:05:45.442
talk for a living more about voiceover
on the iphone because i've seen in an

80
00:05:45.452 --> 00:05:48.802
action but i think our audience might
be a little bit confused how does that

81
00:05:48.802 --> 00:05:53.922
work with because the on ly interface
is the scream any aikens how does that

82
00:05:53.922 --> 00:05:59.152
work and how does it work with special
gestures? Okay, so how to describe it

83
00:05:59.162 --> 00:06:05.542
in words so think about it like this
like if i want to if i'ma sided user

84
00:06:05.752 --> 00:06:10.252
and i'm scrolling wrong along i might
move my finger up and down and that

85
00:06:10.252 --> 00:06:14.512
would let me see the content but if i'm
blind oftentimes what i do is i might

86
00:06:14.522 --> 00:06:19.062
tap or tap on parts of the screen or
double tap to interact with it and when

87
00:06:19.062 --> 00:06:25.552
i do that if i hit a target it'll talk
so the idea is that i can use gestures

88
00:06:25.612 --> 00:06:30.022
to sort of interact semantically with
the tablet as opposed to just scrolling

89
00:06:30.022 --> 00:06:33.822
with a finger and reading it so it
would read for example, the name of the

90
00:06:33.822 --> 00:06:37.942
aps and then if i hear the ad buy wants,
i would step and then it would open

91
00:06:37.942 --> 00:06:42.082
that yeah, stuff like that so like my
friend, what a friend of mine that does

92
00:06:42.092 --> 00:06:46.142
uber all the time on his iphone taps it
in a certain way and i will give him a

93
00:06:46.142 --> 00:06:49.512
sense of where it is on the map and
things like that you could actually use

94
00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:54.092
a lot of absent so long as the
developer codes it in so let's talk

95
00:06:54.092 --> 00:06:59.292
about that as long as the developer
codes it in a little bit. So how well

96
00:06:59.302 --> 00:07:05.072
are we doing at this point? Are most
aps operating systems and websites

97
00:07:05.082 --> 00:07:09.572
accessible? Our day notes are gay
medium assessable how how well we're

98
00:07:09.572 --> 00:07:13.342
doing, i don't think i could give you a
number in terms of a percentage, but a

99
00:07:13.342 --> 00:07:19.292
feeling for me. Yeah, i would say that
there are some companies that do a

100
00:07:19.292 --> 00:07:23.972
really great job and that those air
often somewhat bigger ones but that we

101
00:07:23.972 --> 00:07:28.372
have a really long way to go and that's
not a christmas criticism is just on

102
00:07:28.372 --> 00:07:32.102
observation i mean, oftentimes
developers don't actually get any

103
00:07:32.102 --> 00:07:35.362
training on building these in school
and it's not reveal so it's not like

104
00:07:35.702 --> 00:07:39.412
it's not like we have a long way to go
because the technology's air all bad

105
00:07:39.472 --> 00:07:43.352
for some reason it's just usually don't
even teach this in school all you know,

106
00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:47.012
developer doesn't learn about thie s
accessible libraries on mac, which are

107
00:07:47.012 --> 00:07:52.102
the common thing, or if you're on
desktop platforms, microsoft has its

108
00:07:52.102 --> 00:07:55.442
own libraries, and apple has its own
libraries, and lennox has its own

109
00:07:55.442 --> 00:07:58.172
libraries, and all of them were
different, and none of them are

110
00:07:58.172 --> 00:08:03.712
compatible. So personally, i think that
it would be a lot easier for developers

111
00:08:03.712 --> 00:08:06.752
to develop accessible technology if
there was, like, a unifying standard

112
00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:11.300
across platforms, but that doesn't
really exist at this stage of the game,

113
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.330
at least, yeah, that was one of my
goals in inviting you for an episode is

114
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.850
to make developers more aware and to
help them what they can do to make

115
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:24.100
their so far more accessible, which was
also my next question. So what can we

116
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:29.450
do as the vespers? What are two things
we need to think about when wanting to

117
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:34.490
make our acts more accessible? Okay, so
the first thing to do if you design a

118
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:40.000
website is that there's a special set
of guidelines from the w three c, and

119
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.630
they are specifically for accessibility
don't make sure we're linked to those

120
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.570
and showed no so people can check them
out. Yeah, and those are affected

121
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.690
easily the most comprehensive source
about how to make a website accessible,

122
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:57.760
and they're great. They just tell you
like, if you have a link, how you make

123
00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.020
that accessible, what kind of if you
have a picture and obviously you can't

124
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.870
see it, you put in some kind of all
text, right? And there's there's all

125
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:08.720
sorts of small things that you can do
there's also some online accessibility

126
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.330
checkers that you can use a knight and
they're not perfect. You know, they

127
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:17.140
can't tell you that your website is
easy to use, but sometimes they can at

128
00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.820
least give you, like, a check and
balance for some of the easy thing like,

129
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.040
hey, you forgot your all text for that
image. You should go fix that stuff

130
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.550
like that. You know what? What are some
of the issues? So all taxes, i think

131
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.170
something people are familiar with,
even if they don't know what use it you

132
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:35.290
mentioned links what are best practices
for links that are easy to fix? Okay,

133
00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:40.610
so with links, one thing that is
generally good is to not give your link

134
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:45.700
a moniker that doesn't have semantic
meaning. So, for example, to do this,

135
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.760
go hear the word here should not kill
link, because then when you get it

136
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.940
through the screen and it is going to
stop, it is going to say link here. And

137
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.480
you're going to say wares here, so
we'll be better is to say, go to the

138
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:03.250
website for the block and have that
whole part b a link, it sounds like a

139
00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.500
minor thing, but the screen reader
could make a difference. You have to

140
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.958
listen to it. Yeah, that that is
relatively easy to fix because super so

141
00:10:09.968 --> 00:10:13.248
let me understand how exactly that
we're to screen reader, if you're

142
00:10:13.248 --> 00:10:16.978
navigating, there would be an option to
go through all the links, and if there

143
00:10:16.978 --> 00:10:21.168
were all labeled here, it will be here,
here, whereas if you would say the

144
00:10:21.168 --> 00:10:26.588
website of andrea's org website off
university of nevada as a link, you

145
00:10:26.588 --> 00:10:29.488
could more usually navigate yeah,
that's the kind of idea, like any time

146
00:10:29.488 --> 00:10:32.448
that you have a structure, give it a
semantic meaning that's exactly right?

147
00:10:32.458 --> 00:10:35.848
Yeah, and the other things that are
relatively easy to fix, that we should

148
00:10:35.858 --> 00:10:39.678
think, yeah, eso another one that is
kind of an obvious one. I'll tell you,

149
00:10:39.678 --> 00:10:44.758
when this sort of adorable my daughter
is, like five, and her school does a

150
00:10:44.758 --> 00:10:47.578
great job, but they have a couple
accessibility falls on their website

151
00:10:47.818 --> 00:10:50.908
that are just make maybe laugh a little
bit like they didn't do it

152
00:10:50.908 --> 00:10:54.638
intentionally it's ok, and so one thing
that they did that that just i thought

153
00:10:54.638 --> 00:10:58.418
was funny is they wanted to put a
schedule online so what they did is

154
00:10:58.418 --> 00:11:01.958
they took a picture of the schedule
like a complicated spreadsheets and

155
00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:06.348
then they put that onto the website and
then it shrunk so if you're visually

156
00:11:06.348 --> 00:11:09.808
impaired you can't actually read it
because the text is to blot it out and

157
00:11:09.808 --> 00:11:12.218
if you have a screen reader you're
going to get to that thing and it's

158
00:11:12.218 --> 00:11:17.338
going to say image so you can't
actually do anything so one thing to do

159
00:11:17.348 --> 00:11:21.138
is don't like replace content with
already accessible things you know if

160
00:11:21.138 --> 00:11:24.638
you need to have a table, put a table
in there and then give it the market

161
00:11:24.638 --> 00:11:29.208
that it needs from the w three c so
images to be for making your upside

162
00:11:29.218 --> 00:11:33.628
nice here but they shouldn't be
replacing consents exactly also have

163
00:11:33.638 --> 00:11:38.958
bean represented sexually that's
correct that is actual invites so what

164
00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:43.828
about a user interface if we're no no
longer talking about a website but

165
00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:48.388
something that has buttons and drop
down menus scroll bars why we do in

166
00:11:48.388 --> 00:11:51.878
those so that's a little bit trickier
because it depends on the platform and

167
00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:56.948
it also depends on the a p i that
you're using so for example, if you're

168
00:11:56.948 --> 00:12:00.958
using java unfortunately, while java
technically has an accessibility

169
00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.988
architecture er a lot of it doesn't
really work that well or in some cases

170
00:12:04.988 --> 00:12:09.618
really at all so this is unfortunate
not because you know it just is but

171
00:12:09.618 --> 00:12:13.592
because if you're a developer you might
be thinking all right i'm going code to

172
00:12:13.592 --> 00:12:16.642
the accessibility interface is gonna be
awesome gonna make this totally

173
00:12:16.642 --> 00:12:20.562
accessible and then you turn it on on a
particular platform and you're like, oh,

174
00:12:20.562 --> 00:12:24.472
it doesn't work and you can verify that
by turning on the screen which you're

175
00:12:24.482 --> 00:12:27.852
free often times and so you just flip
it on and say oh, it doesnt make sound

176
00:12:27.852 --> 00:12:32.362
i'll give an example in the net beans
development environment second two of

177
00:12:32.362 --> 00:12:37.292
programmers the text editor didn't work
for years so it's like the fundamental

178
00:12:37.292 --> 00:12:40.972
thing like about how to use a
development environment like writing

179
00:12:40.972 --> 00:12:45.782
text but it was not accessible what was
wrong with job is accessibility system

180
00:12:45.782 --> 00:12:51.492
doesn't work wow and it's you know it
is what it is and there are other there

181
00:12:51.492 --> 00:12:55.802
are other types of environments that
are much more accessible so for example

182
00:12:56.002 --> 00:13:00.072
microsoft for whatever reason gets flak
a lot but for accessibility they've got

183
00:13:00.072 --> 00:13:05.702
a pretty dang good job right they ap
eyes worked pretty well they're not

184
00:13:05.712 --> 00:13:09.472
perfect but there well thought through
over many years and they're compatible

185
00:13:09.472 --> 00:13:14.852
with a lot of systems is not a plug for
microsoft i've no vested interest but

186
00:13:14.862 --> 00:13:17.882
they have this thing called i
accessible to and basically if you

187
00:13:17.882 --> 00:13:22.022
kowtow accessible to then your stuff is
almost certain to be accessible but if

188
00:13:22.022 --> 00:13:25.342
you're working at sort of a higher
level then sort of the little level old

189
00:13:25.342 --> 00:13:29.702
calm type stuff and you're just using
sheet c sharp they've done a pretty

190
00:13:29.702 --> 00:13:34.242
damn good job of like building it in so
that buttons and text boxes and stuff

191
00:13:34.242 --> 00:13:39.252
like that are mostly accessible night
so if you stick with development tools

192
00:13:39.252 --> 00:13:43.512
from big platforms usually there are
okay, well, it depends on the platform

193
00:13:43.512 --> 00:13:47.292
job is pretty big too, but it's
debatable whether it's accessible

194
00:13:47.292 --> 00:13:51.442
depending on platform where c sharp is
at least pretty dang accessible on

195
00:13:51.442 --> 00:13:56.292
windows and there's a mac, they do have
something called an s accessible and

196
00:13:56.292 --> 00:14:00.182
that does work pretty well if you're on
ly writing in the mac go system, the

197
00:14:00.182 --> 00:14:03.132
tricky thing is, whenever you're using
other programming languages in those

198
00:14:03.132 --> 00:14:08.282
ecosystems like, for example, is small
talk accessible is python accessible

199
00:14:08.292 --> 00:14:12.659
it's kind of you have to take it on a
case by case basis because of the

200
00:14:12.669 --> 00:14:17.209
platform yeah see of those tools but by
from the windows is different from

201
00:14:17.209 --> 00:14:22.639
biting a mech candy. It depends on what
the dabs implemented. So so there still

202
00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:26.129
some to some things that we need to
know about nest developers because the

203
00:14:26.139 --> 00:14:29.659
platforms are going to take care of it?
Yeah, in fact, this is one reason why

204
00:14:29.659 --> 00:14:32.849
i've cared about the consistency of
programming languages in part because

205
00:14:32.859 --> 00:14:37.299
it impacts some groups pretty poorly,
like the blind, you know, like i'll

206
00:14:37.299 --> 00:14:40.589
give an example are tools for the blind,
i think your written in like, eight

207
00:14:40.589 --> 00:14:44.329
programming languages and we don't want
them to be, but we have to connect to

208
00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:47.589
these different systems. There's really
no choice, something like that sixty

209
00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:53.729
eight i forget a lot a lot here is not
of the books. So what about other

210
00:14:53.729 --> 00:14:57.189
things that we should take care of? So
one of things that has surprised me a

211
00:14:57.189 --> 00:15:01.769
lot in working with, like children only
a little bit is that some stuff like

212
00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:06.529
working with the mouse takes lots of
energy if you're visually impaired but

213
00:15:06.529 --> 00:15:10.699
not entirely blind so you can see a
little bit, so we sighted people would

214
00:15:10.699 --> 00:15:14.739
think, oh, you can use the mouse, but
tracing where the mouse cursor is and

215
00:15:14.739 --> 00:15:18.629
using the mouse takes lots of energy
that was this thing that surprised me

216
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:22.079
loans are there are a few other things
that we like this that we should think

217
00:15:22.089 --> 00:15:26.039
about, yeah, and actually there's some
stuff that greeted hui tool kit

218
00:15:26.039 --> 00:15:29.639
designers khun do that are pretty easy.
So for example, if you're designing

219
00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:33.219
some kind of a text box type interface
and it doesn't have any textbooks but

220
00:15:33.219 --> 00:15:36.739
something that you would follow a
pointer whenever the point your moves,

221
00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:40.809
if someone is magnified, follow it
right so that if you're moving a

222
00:15:40.809 --> 00:15:44.409
magnification system, they always have
the context of where the most important

223
00:15:44.409 --> 00:15:49.149
thing is i'm sort of full focus should
full of occurred are yes ok, yeah so

224
00:15:49.149 --> 00:15:52.919
like if you're like for example, one of
my old students i shouldn't say his

225
00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:59.069
name since you know, because he happens
to be blind right? And he used a

226
00:15:59.069 --> 00:16:02.969
magnifier pretty heavily and when he
would use just typical gooey elements

227
00:16:02.969 --> 00:16:07.219
for example, imagine if you pressed a
button and opened a menu, but it didn't

228
00:16:07.219 --> 00:16:11.049
jump to that menu and you're highly
magnified it's a lot easier if the

229
00:16:11.049 --> 00:16:14.299
magnification system follows you but
not all the operating systems do that.

230
00:16:14.638 --> 00:16:18.828
Oh, and then you'd have to scroll,
which is super hard yes magnify yeah,

231
00:16:18.838 --> 00:16:22.218
so i clicked the menu and then have to,
like, tap the mouse a bunch to sort of

232
00:16:22.218 --> 00:16:26.598
get it up there and hope that you can
find it the gets tricky so focus is a

233
00:16:26.598 --> 00:16:31.718
big issue focuses a huge issue you
rejection, any order, huge issues like

234
00:16:31.718 --> 00:16:36.418
that let's see so for in terms of
trying to make general user interfaces

235
00:16:36.418 --> 00:16:40.068
accessible won that my team has been
working on that i think it's really fun

236
00:16:40.078 --> 00:16:43.478
is we've been trying to figure out how
to make graphics accessible, so here

237
00:16:43.478 --> 00:16:47.308
here's the tricky part if you've got
something like like let's just say

238
00:16:47.318 --> 00:16:51.108
unity three d which is sort of like
this game designed platform right? We

239
00:16:51.108 --> 00:16:55.418
have ah grant from the national science
foundation right now to try to take big,

240
00:16:55.418 --> 00:16:58.638
complicated three d interfaces like
that make him buy accessible but here's

241
00:16:58.638 --> 00:17:02.508
the rub well, you could make buttons
and stuff like that accessible there's

242
00:17:02.508 --> 00:17:06.248
just no way you can tell open g l make
yourself blind accessible there just is

243
00:17:06.248 --> 00:17:11.078
no tool it is inherent visual it is
inherently visual accept any kind of

244
00:17:11.078 --> 00:17:14.208
three d application still has things
you could potentially tele screen

245
00:17:14.208 --> 00:17:18.508
reader about so for example, if i'm
navigating terrain or something like

246
00:17:18.508 --> 00:17:21.928
that are trying to adjust to rain or a
three d model hypothetically you could

247
00:17:21.928 --> 00:17:26.137
provide a list of things that could be
positions on that terrain and tell it

248
00:17:26.137 --> 00:17:29.628
to go up and down which would still
give a screen reader information. So

249
00:17:29.628 --> 00:17:33.068
one of the things we're trying to
invent in the lab is a way for blind

250
00:17:33.068 --> 00:17:36.408
children to be able to write their own
three d computer games and be able to

251
00:17:36.408 --> 00:17:39.618
adjust it through their typical
screening device without needing any

252
00:17:39.618 --> 00:17:42.938
special stuff while still having it the
hardware accelerated and all that stuff

253
00:17:43.298 --> 00:17:47.388
it's been a hard project that's taking
me four years to get a handle around in

254
00:17:47.388 --> 00:17:51.308
my brain but i think we're getting
pretty close and are those things that

255
00:17:51.308 --> 00:17:55.868
also usable for let's say more
practical things that are inherently

256
00:17:55.868 --> 00:18:01.628
visual i'm thinking off a diagram or a
map or a graph see that's the thing if

257
00:18:01.628 --> 00:18:04.638
you could do that for the hard stuff
and graphics any of the rest comes

258
00:18:04.738 --> 00:18:05.848
comes easily yeah

259
00:18:06.848 --> 00:18:10.518
oh yeah we talked about frameworks and
libraries ready a little bit. So you

260
00:18:10.528 --> 00:18:15.938
mentioned and ass accessible that's a
framework that we can use to make stuff

261
00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:19.958
more accessible? Sort of out of the
books are there are other things we

262
00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:23.728
should check out frameworks of
libraries. Yeah, the big one's, the big.

263
00:18:23.738 --> 00:18:27.688
The two biggest ones are anice
accessible on mac and i accessible to

264
00:18:27.688 --> 00:18:33.038
on windows. But i think since in terms
of the web, by far the two things that

265
00:18:33.038 --> 00:18:36.748
people should know about the w three c
accessibility standards and also this

266
00:18:36.748 --> 00:18:40.498
thing called aria this mildly mildly
hard to google sometimes you don't have

267
00:18:40.498 --> 00:18:48.158
to say a r i a space accessibility, but
the idea is that the w three c

268
00:18:48.158 --> 00:18:51.278
standards sort of tell you any pretty
much anything you would need to know

269
00:18:51.278 --> 00:18:55.738
about basic like content. And the aria
standards are really good at trying to

270
00:18:55.738 --> 00:18:59.838
help you understand like interactive
content, cool or audio up to a jag

271
00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:03.418
stuff things like that we'll make sure
we at all of that to the show notes so

272
00:19:03.418 --> 00:19:05.548
people that want to know more comtech
it out the sleeve

273
00:19:07.058 --> 00:19:13.248
so so far we've mainly talked about to
everyday tools that many people use

274
00:19:13.248 --> 00:19:19.338
like a website or an actor or a phone
but there's also people that program

275
00:19:19.348 --> 00:19:23.818
while blinds and we use the vespers
might make tools for people that want a

276
00:19:23.828 --> 00:19:30.568
program also more accessible so i want
to talk about that a little bit how do

277
00:19:30.568 --> 00:19:35.418
blind people program and what should we
know by blind developers to make

278
00:19:35.418 --> 00:19:40.748
developed tools more assessable yes so
actually blind developers fall into the

279
00:19:40.748 --> 00:19:45.688
same category so either visually
impaired or totally blind and they do

280
00:19:45.698 --> 00:19:50.738
amazingly interesting things. So for
example a number of line developers

281
00:19:50.738 --> 00:19:53.548
that design technologies for all sorts
of things one of one of my good friends

282
00:19:53.558 --> 00:19:58.558
his name is signor graham he designs
accessibility installations for museums

283
00:19:58.558 --> 00:20:01.878
he he won this award from the white
house a bunch of years back and got

284
00:20:01.878 --> 00:20:05.178
connected with museums all over the
world to build like weird, accessible

285
00:20:05.178 --> 00:20:08.208
interfaces and stuff like that if you
go to your museum there's an accessible

286
00:20:08.208 --> 00:20:11.748
thing it's very likely he's been
involved in some capacity or another.

287
00:20:11.758 --> 00:20:15.268
So what are we thinking about
accessible museums then someone that's

288
00:20:15.268 --> 00:20:18.923
describing the painting i could be all
sorts of stuff and to be honest, i'm

289
00:20:18.923 --> 00:20:22.483
not exactly sure all the details of
what he does but i've seen like some

290
00:20:22.483 --> 00:20:26.533
stuff here and there it seems pretty
cool but the point is as the point

291
00:20:26.533 --> 00:20:30.123
isn't so much the details of what he
does it's how he does it so how does he

292
00:20:30.133 --> 00:20:34.003
do it? So what he does is he uses his
screen reader and then he listens to

293
00:20:34.003 --> 00:20:37.943
the text now there's some obvious
complexity there so for example, if you

294
00:20:38.263 --> 00:20:42.523
two sided users sometimes as developers
we don't really think about the sort of

295
00:20:42.523 --> 00:20:46.783
weird wacky syntax that happens but is
a blind developer you literally have to

296
00:20:46.783 --> 00:20:50.243
listen to for left brandon cycle zero
cynical and i was intense public alumni

297
00:20:50.243 --> 00:20:55.133
list i suppose right friend left brace
yourself like that so it's free reader

298
00:20:55.143 --> 00:20:59.593
that's normally used for text is then
used in source code and it just reads

299
00:20:59.613 --> 00:21:03.763
old symbols yeah and it's not like you
can't get used to it but the problem is

300
00:21:03.933 --> 00:21:07.113
it depends you know a lot on like where
you are in the development pipeline

301
00:21:07.113 --> 00:21:10.573
like if you're an experienced super
experienced professional you've already

302
00:21:10.573 --> 00:21:13.823
made it past all the barriers and
you're good to go then yeah, you're

303
00:21:13.823 --> 00:21:17.473
going to be fine, but we've also spent
a lot of time talking to blind children

304
00:21:17.703 --> 00:21:21.393
and let's just say the first time that
a blind child hears for left handed

305
00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:23.953
like was there a some clothes i wasn't
sent simon cohen on post post right

306
00:21:23.953 --> 00:21:28.023
prem left grace it's a little weird and
it sort of makes you wonder why

307
00:21:28.023 --> 00:21:29.323
languages are built that way

308
00:21:30.843 --> 00:21:36.643
for enough so for the let's say end
user tools we talked about navigation

309
00:21:36.643 --> 00:21:41.603
being a huge issue i can imagine that
is for programming as well i think if i

310
00:21:41.793 --> 00:21:46.833
read golden and infirm eriks code base
i would scroll open on to see what

311
00:21:46.833 --> 00:21:51.933
other classes when other methods how
does the screen reader for blind people

312
00:21:51.933 --> 00:21:55.333
navigate smersh code? Because does it
have hatters there's a take the

313
00:21:55.333 --> 00:21:59.713
contacts into account or you could skip
from the one class to the other yes and

314
00:21:59.713 --> 00:22:04.603
no so it does but in the same way you
know how when you're using a

315
00:22:04.613 --> 00:22:07.893
development tool oftentimes you might
have a little like navigators off to

316
00:22:07.893 --> 00:22:10.993
the side and it'll have the list of the
classes and methods you click on him

317
00:22:11.423 --> 00:22:15.763
oftentimes those air accessible so you
can still jump around. However, that

318
00:22:15.763 --> 00:22:20.459
doesn't mean it's easy, so when you're
done, i think one of the harder things

319
00:22:20.469 --> 00:22:25.019
for blind individuals is that you can
navigate a little bit and there's a

320
00:22:25.019 --> 00:22:27.409
number of research teams that are
working on making those navigators

321
00:22:27.409 --> 00:22:31.059
better. But the one of the trickier
part of if you've got like a long

322
00:22:31.059 --> 00:22:35.029
method, getting context can be
difficult. So you know twenty lines of

323
00:22:35.039 --> 00:22:38.229
really complicated code you have to
kind of memorize it to figure out

324
00:22:38.229 --> 00:22:42.209
what's going on depending upon what
you're doing oh so you're saying if you

325
00:22:42.209 --> 00:22:46.889
want to comprehend and methods maybe
you read one line read another line but

326
00:22:46.889 --> 00:22:49.979
you need to remember all of those
whereas if you recited the fell apart

327
00:22:49.979 --> 00:22:53.409
you could skip down to maybe the loop
that's in the methods and like, oh, it

328
00:22:53.409 --> 00:22:57.179
loops over all the customers are
whatever that's yeah exactly so like if

329
00:22:57.179 --> 00:23:01.199
i'm looking at a screen of code, i can
kind of glance up and down to get very

330
00:23:01.199 --> 00:23:05.459
quick context that's a little bit
harder if you're blind or i guess many

331
00:23:05.459 --> 00:23:08.629
of my blind friends would probably say
that it's not this way harder but maybe

332
00:23:08.629 --> 00:23:16.919
slower yeah or different different yeah
arter things we can do as developers in

333
00:23:16.919 --> 00:23:21.639
that respect, what can we do to make
developer tools more accessible? For

334
00:23:21.639 --> 00:23:26.699
example, that navigation can we make
resource go more easily navigate herbal

335
00:23:27.109 --> 00:23:32.499
for source code it's tough? I think
that the bigger issues are number one

336
00:23:32.499 --> 00:23:36.409
many of the development ides aren't
very accessible or if they are

337
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:40.519
accessible they sort of break every
other release and it's again it's not

338
00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:44.049
like it's malicious or anything it's
just people don't think about it. So

339
00:23:44.059 --> 00:23:49.239
for example visual studio is sort of
accessible right now, but historically

340
00:23:49.509 --> 00:23:53.339
it's sort of you know is sort of
accessible sort of not depending on the

341
00:23:53.339 --> 00:23:59.229
release or even if it is accessible for
certain ieds sometimes they make rather

342
00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:03.829
adorable decisions, so for example i
remember boyfriend which version of

343
00:24:03.829 --> 00:24:07.389
visual studio it was but i recall there
was a little too bugger label and had

344
00:24:07.389 --> 00:24:11.449
an arrow wanted and so if europe a
blind person or like let's say a child

345
00:24:11.759 --> 00:24:14.579
instead of giving you information about
what you're doing in the departure

346
00:24:14.579 --> 00:24:18.909
would say like graphic fifty three and
it's like i get it you can learn that

347
00:24:18.919 --> 00:24:22.146
but it's sort of weird you have to
write so is that what you mean with

348
00:24:22.146 --> 00:24:26.576
short of accessible can you explain a
little bit more more detail what what

349
00:24:26.576 --> 00:24:31.876
does it mean if something is sword off
accessible it was sort off what is it

350
00:24:31.886 --> 00:24:35.486
and what parts is inaccessible and what
parts isn't it i'm trying to think how

351
00:24:35.486 --> 00:24:38.966
to describe this like have you ever
been on a website and like you could

352
00:24:38.966 --> 00:24:45.316
use it but it's sort of bothered you
yeah doesn't fuel logical right like

353
00:24:45.326 --> 00:24:49.286
the links are on weird places and it
looks strange and stuff like that

354
00:24:49.296 --> 00:24:55.256
that's true for accessible interface is
a cz well so example if you're a page

355
00:24:55.256 --> 00:24:58.386
wasn't structured with proper
formatting then you wouldn't be able to

356
00:24:58.386 --> 00:25:03.286
navigate its you might go to like go up
and down with bunch of giant paragraphs

357
00:25:03.586 --> 00:25:07.526
but you would definitely be annoyed and
with ideas is kind of a similar

358
00:25:07.526 --> 00:25:11.426
situation it's sort of like you might
be able to navigate the source code

359
00:25:11.426 --> 00:25:15.456
editor but maybe navigation doesn't
work maybe certain features are broken

360
00:25:15.676 --> 00:25:19.206
maybe you'll get to certain windows you
can't navigate through amore the

361
00:25:19.206 --> 00:25:22.746
preferences window won't be accessible
with the other windows are maybe the

362
00:25:22.746 --> 00:25:26.596
file save dialogue is broken so that
this is the thing is that a lot of

363
00:25:26.596 --> 00:25:30.566
these id's is not so much that they're
good or bad is a whole ofthe times

364
00:25:30.566 --> 00:25:34.686
they're just weirdly inconsistent, so
certain interfaces will be broken for a

365
00:25:34.686 --> 00:25:38.816
release or two makes it kind of hard,
especially if you're lerner, but for

366
00:25:38.816 --> 00:25:43.906
professionals to yeah could measure
inconsistency is bad for any

367
00:25:43.916 --> 00:25:47.566
demographic? Yeah, pretty much and i
think it's easy for a deaf to

368
00:25:47.566 --> 00:25:51.446
accidentally screwed up because they
don't do it every like there. I think a

369
00:25:51.446 --> 00:25:54.966
lot of designers they don't usually
test with the screen reader, and so

370
00:25:54.966 --> 00:25:58.876
they don't really notice when something
is broken for the blind. Yeah, going to

371
00:25:58.876 --> 00:26:04.536
that point, what are things we could do
if we are in the field off making id's

372
00:26:04.536 --> 00:26:08.526
or mention any plug ins? One thing we
could do is tested with a scream.

373
00:26:08.526 --> 00:26:13.106
Rainier do you have other concrete tips?
Suppose we're in the business of

374
00:26:13.106 --> 00:26:17.526
developing iii's are related to that or
for programmers, what do we need to

375
00:26:17.536 --> 00:26:21.706
check so there's a few things? Number
one is if you're at a big company and

376
00:26:21.706 --> 00:26:24.626
you have the cash, you can get a
consultant to help because it is tricky

377
00:26:24.861 --> 00:26:28.161
and so don't assume that like you have
to figure it all out yourself there's

378
00:26:28.161 --> 00:26:32.571
lots of people out there that know how
to do it and that can help with it,

379
00:26:32.871 --> 00:26:37.801
especially on the web. The web is not
perfect nowadays but it's so much

380
00:26:37.801 --> 00:26:43.231
better today than it was, you know,
twenty years ago whatever and so that's

381
00:26:43.231 --> 00:26:47.841
number one number two even though
definitely turning on a screen reader

382
00:26:47.841 --> 00:26:52.251
is a good thing and can help figure
stuff out the the one tricky thing to

383
00:26:52.251 --> 00:26:57.331
do is to check it compared to a variety
of disability. So think that one thing

384
00:26:57.331 --> 00:27:01.371
just kind of go through a checklist of
what those could be. So for example, if

385
00:27:01.371 --> 00:27:04.761
you are totally blind, you might use a
screen reader but ifyou're visually

386
00:27:04.761 --> 00:27:09.511
impaired, which is a lie a lot more
people than you might think of issues

387
00:27:09.511 --> 00:27:12.651
like color contrast and those air on
light there's only checkers for that

388
00:27:12.871 --> 00:27:17.041
and it's really easy to do and even if
you're not blind that's helpful there

389
00:27:17.041 --> 00:27:20.921
too because like the color contrast
helps people read your page, people

390
00:27:20.921 --> 00:27:23.871
could be colorblind, they benefit they
could also be colorblind, but they

391
00:27:23.871 --> 00:27:27.311
could also just like it makes it easier
to read like, for example, you know if

392
00:27:27.311 --> 00:27:30.811
you have black text on white background
that's really easy to read but black

393
00:27:30.811 --> 00:27:35.081
text on dark gray background maybe not
so much and so a lot of the issues that

394
00:27:35.081 --> 00:27:38.881
you do with accessibility they tend to
have these other little benefits like

395
00:27:38.891 --> 00:27:43.731
your sight is generally easier reading
so so that our top tips get

396
00:27:43.731 --> 00:27:50.211
consultant's help if you can pay for it
or use your own at or website or idee

397
00:27:50.211 --> 00:27:53.851
with a screen radio and we'll just see
how it feels screen reader enabled but

398
00:27:53.861 --> 00:27:57.611
also don't forget that the visually
impaired community is larger than the

399
00:27:57.611 --> 00:28:01.941
totally blind community so think about
things like magnification color

400
00:28:01.941 --> 00:28:05.661
contrasts and stuff like that you know
we haven't really talked about the

401
00:28:05.671 --> 00:28:10.541
braille interface and lords oh yeah
actually it sounds weird but actually a

402
00:28:10.541 --> 00:28:14.181
lot of the blind community doesn't
actually know braille that is present

403
00:28:14.191 --> 00:28:18.331
yeah it's sort of a bizarre quirks but
think about it like this if you're

404
00:28:18.341 --> 00:28:22.081
blind and you go blind later in life,
the question is do i just turn on a

405
00:28:22.081 --> 00:28:26.021
screen reader which i can download at
no cost or die by rail to speed for

406
00:28:26.021 --> 00:28:30.805
like three to ten thousand dollars and
have to learn braille right? So it's

407
00:28:30.805 --> 00:28:35.015
kind of a barrier however, if you're at
if you're a young person and you know

408
00:28:35.015 --> 00:28:39.985
blind from birth or or very young
oftentimes it's a good idea to learn

409
00:28:39.985 --> 00:28:44.035
braille skills because it's a nice way
to read i'm so far as i understand it

410
00:28:44.045 --> 00:28:48.505
but for us as developers the bro
interface is not as big of a chunk of

411
00:28:48.515 --> 00:28:52.115
the people we could reach as is
optimized more scream read that's true

412
00:28:52.115 --> 00:28:55.935
and if it if your interface is
accessible you most of the time get the

413
00:28:55.945 --> 00:29:00.805
railing sign for free now there is some
tricky stuff like for example, braille

414
00:29:00.805 --> 00:29:05.055
standards change over time and computer
symbols in braille like that using

415
00:29:05.055 --> 00:29:09.105
programming language languages don't
always come out well, so there's really

416
00:29:09.115 --> 00:29:12.915
getting really i'm not exactly sure
which ones i have a friend that's a

417
00:29:12.915 --> 00:29:16.585
braille expert and i'm that's not it
sounds like you would know about all

418
00:29:16.585 --> 00:29:20.065
these things, but a lot of these really
complicated and braille is one of those

419
00:29:20.065 --> 00:29:24.085
areas i know less about, but yet little
weird symbols that we often use in

420
00:29:24.085 --> 00:29:25.745
programming languages for whatever
reason,

421
00:29:26.945 --> 00:29:31.735
so so far we talked about tools, abs
websites and e what thing that's really

422
00:29:31.735 --> 00:29:35.425
important to developers that we haven't
covered is the comm outline? Does this

423
00:29:35.425 --> 00:29:39.925
create a way to work on the command
line? What does it read? Is that better

424
00:29:39.925 --> 00:29:43.715
interface for people that are visually
impaired than running it from a

425
00:29:43.715 --> 00:29:47.235
nineteen you for example, i say i
wouldn't say it's better, but it's

426
00:29:47.235 --> 00:29:51.755
definitely most of the time they're
accessible, so a command line interface

427
00:29:51.755 --> 00:29:56.205
is definitely a nice fall back, but
when you think about it oftentimes when

428
00:29:56.205 --> 00:30:00.055
your programming a command line
interface is okay, but id's offing all

429
00:30:00.055 --> 00:30:04.205
sorts of stuff like auto factoring and
all that all that so sometimes it is

430
00:30:04.205 --> 00:30:08.145
nice to be able to use an i d which is
why, you know, people think prefer it

431
00:30:08.395 --> 00:30:11.775
however a command line interface is
almost always accessible, which is why

432
00:30:11.785 --> 00:30:15.035
it's not a bad option if you have to.
Okay, so it's a good idea to have come

433
00:30:15.035 --> 00:30:18.185
out into freight kamala and phrase
because it sort of assessment by

434
00:30:18.185 --> 00:30:21.115
default yeah, you're probably gonna
have accessibility support if you use

435
00:30:21.115 --> 00:30:26.085
one, you know? So you briefly touched
the bone re factoring support as one of

436
00:30:26.085 --> 00:30:32.104
the things that an i d offers us
sighted people are those features that

437
00:30:32.114 --> 00:30:36.554
blind people can use because if i think
of you factoring i e i think of many

438
00:30:36.554 --> 00:30:41.404
things that are visual let's say the
rename refractory i think of selecting

439
00:30:41.404 --> 00:30:45.604
a variable i think of right clicking,
getting a context menu, selecting

440
00:30:45.614 --> 00:30:49.524
renamed rue factoring, getting a bull
pup that says what's the new name

441
00:30:49.714 --> 00:30:54.084
getting a preview of how my source code
would look like in a new version is

442
00:30:54.084 --> 00:30:58.184
like visual, visual, visual visual yeah,
it sounds like it wouldn't be, but they

443
00:30:58.184 --> 00:31:02.084
usually are yeah, and then we have to
be but they usually are yeah, and the

444
00:31:02.084 --> 00:31:05.634
reason is because they no, most of the
time, they use normal, gooey elements

445
00:31:05.634 --> 00:31:09.174
like context, menus and stuff like
you're saying, and most of the time, if

446
00:31:09.174 --> 00:31:13.684
you program it correctly and, like java,
isn't broken for accessibility, then

447
00:31:13.694 --> 00:31:17.164
yes, they're accessible. But i should
say, i'm not trying to pick on java is

448
00:31:17.164 --> 00:31:21.794
just happens to be not accessible if
that's the way it is, the weakness. I

449
00:31:21.794 --> 00:31:27.594
was also thinking about testing, which
also is often inherently visual in the

450
00:31:27.594 --> 00:31:33.174
sense that failing tests would get mad,
i thought, yeah, yeah, just do scream

451
00:31:33.174 --> 00:31:37.874
readers read those thoughts. I'm not
sure about the specific interface for,

452
00:31:37.874 --> 00:31:42.304
like j unit or something, but generally
speaking, those things can be coded to

453
00:31:42.304 --> 00:31:45.454
be accessible. And also you can just
dump it to the command line and then

454
00:31:45.454 --> 00:31:48.594
it'll be accessible. Teo far enough.
And what about quigley's?

455
00:31:50.744 --> 00:31:56.024
Okay, that's tricky. So there's are a
few things in interfaces that are

456
00:31:56.024 --> 00:32:01.634
highly visual aren't super accessible,
so little squid lee's actually are,

457
00:32:01.644 --> 00:32:04.504
believe it or not, or at least you
could make them and there's a couple

458
00:32:04.504 --> 00:32:09.044
ways you can do it. One is what we do
in some of our tools with wind. When

459
00:32:09.044 --> 00:32:13.064
you have a squiggly at the very, very
like point, one seconds will go like

460
00:32:13.804 --> 00:32:16.944
something like that so that way the
thing is is that you need it to be

461
00:32:16.944 --> 00:32:19.274
right at the beginning of the
lancastrian eyebrows you'll be like

462
00:32:19.274 --> 00:32:23.784
going up and down between variables
like this line this line and then you

463
00:32:23.784 --> 00:32:26.954
can hear right away that there's an
error on the line. So then in that case

464
00:32:26.954 --> 00:32:30.668
you might you can either query for the
air you can check your compile bach or

465
00:32:30.668 --> 00:32:34.528
you can wait to the end of the line and
we embedded at the end of the line so

466
00:32:34.528 --> 00:32:38.088
then it would be different from how
signing people would perceive it

467
00:32:38.088 --> 00:32:42.258
because for us the squiggly sometimes
is not in there the entire line but in

468
00:32:42.258 --> 00:32:46.478
a in the departure of the line that is
the issue. Oh, yeah, clarity will be

469
00:32:46.478 --> 00:32:50.388
slightly different because you get the
error at the beginning of the line so

470
00:32:50.388 --> 00:32:55.368
it's a bit less, i think that's right
information. Yeah, but that's ok, cool.

471
00:32:55.378 --> 00:33:01.098
So all these things that we perceive as
visual are understandable for blind

472
00:33:01.118 --> 00:33:04.958
users. Really? Sometimes i mean, there
are tricky ones. I was just thinking of

473
00:33:04.958 --> 00:33:09.048
one s o if you ever used one of those
like interfaces for gifts that are

474
00:33:09.048 --> 00:33:13.958
highly visual def so yeah, you get like
red is just lines and green is the same

475
00:33:13.958 --> 00:33:17.078
lines compared to the previous
committed or to moscow yeah, it would

476
00:33:17.078 --> 00:33:20.088
be awesome if those were accessible but
i'm not totally sure how to do it

477
00:33:20.098 --> 00:33:24.188
because they're really, really visual
and they often use non standard

478
00:33:24.188 --> 00:33:28.508
components so like custom little
drawing tools and things like that so i

479
00:33:28.508 --> 00:33:32.688
think it's probably possible i've just
uh never trying you in theory you could

480
00:33:32.688 --> 00:33:35.528
have something similar where you have
the cliques at the beginning of the

481
00:33:35.528 --> 00:33:39.838
line for what is red and green for one
that's the same yeah and blind people

482
00:33:39.838 --> 00:33:43.208
definitely can and do use version
control so for example i know we used

483
00:33:43.208 --> 00:33:47.358
to have a number of blind children
doing lego robot competitions and so

484
00:33:47.358 --> 00:33:50.708
they would use i fire akane correctly
they'd use get to send files back and

485
00:33:50.708 --> 00:33:54.478
forth to each other because the command
lines accessible and we make it

486
00:33:54.478 --> 00:33:57.768
accessible in some of our little ideas
to you just we just could never get

487
00:33:57.768 --> 00:34:02.208
like visual defying working thing is a
hard problem in general even for people

488
00:34:02.208 --> 00:34:05.288
that can see it kind of is and even if
you get it on the command line all

489
00:34:05.288 --> 00:34:09.058
those weird little get symbols yeah,
those air unreadable by anybody yeah

490
00:34:09.068 --> 00:34:13.338
they're waiting for me in me too i want
to talk a little bit more about the

491
00:34:13.348 --> 00:34:17.568
process of development so suppose you
were a blind or visually impaired

492
00:34:17.568 --> 00:34:21.608
developer inside the company and you
want to communicate architecture how

493
00:34:21.608 --> 00:34:25.558
would you use your mel diagram
generally speaking, you ml is not

494
00:34:25.558 --> 00:34:30.848
accessible at all on dh when i say that
what i mean is that oftentimes you emma

495
00:34:30.848 --> 00:34:34.588
was rendered in some way so you could
do it if you either had a graphical

496
00:34:34.588 --> 00:34:39.568
render some other approach however
oftentimes all you, um it'll really

497
00:34:39.568 --> 00:34:43.348
does is provide you a sense of the
structure and there's lots of ways to

498
00:34:43.348 --> 00:34:46.908
navigate structure. So in other words,
if you're out of design meeting and you

499
00:34:46.908 --> 00:34:51.158
put uml up on the board yeah that's not
gonna help but if you have like a

500
00:34:51.158 --> 00:34:54.478
development tool where you can navigate
the classes and read the code, then

501
00:34:54.478 --> 00:34:57.428
that's the way that you could be
inclusive of a person that's blind even

502
00:34:57.428 --> 00:35:01.288
if the rest of the team is using uml at
the same time. So as long as it's a

503
00:35:01.288 --> 00:35:06.058
textural and structural representation
you can represent class iran's but the

504
00:35:06.068 --> 00:35:09.748
visual version would be very tricky
pretty much now there was a really cool

505
00:35:09.748 --> 00:35:13.248
dissertation done on a few years back.
I think the guy's name was alistair

506
00:35:13.248 --> 00:35:19.258
king and his great work but i don't
think that there's really a lot that's

507
00:35:19.258 --> 00:35:23.798
happened to make it accessible besides
one person's serious, dedicated effort

508
00:35:24.288 --> 00:35:27.728
yeah, so that's something if we develop
there the fella person we want to be

509
00:35:27.728 --> 00:35:32.568
inclusive of people back and see your
can see well we just shoot a news

510
00:35:32.568 --> 00:35:35.948
diagrams we should keep to structural
information that is in the code base

511
00:35:35.948 --> 00:35:39.378
rather than auxiliary document yeah, i
mean and you know how this stuff is

512
00:35:39.378 --> 00:35:42.428
anyway it kind of gets out of date and
whether yeah, yeah, i'm sure there are

513
00:35:42.428 --> 00:35:46.808
also a few dissertations that say, well,
the jumiller grams they got outdated

514
00:35:46.808 --> 00:35:51.118
super quickly, right? Or have you read
that wonderful paper by marion petrie?

515
00:35:51.128 --> 00:35:54.738
You know which one i'm talking about?
No, i don't think i do what's the thing

516
00:35:54.758 --> 00:35:58.938
that i think it's called you a melon
practice she basically asked the

517
00:35:58.938 --> 00:36:03.448
question of do people actually use uml?
And the answer was pretty much not much

518
00:36:03.458 --> 00:36:08.628
yeah, so i mean macy paper thinking he
was an ex way linked to that is shown

519
00:36:08.628 --> 00:36:11.678
in its look very related to distort it
but it's a great paper,

520
00:36:12.888 --> 00:36:17.118
ok, so far we've talked about it
sensibility in tools, websites and for

521
00:36:17.118 --> 00:36:21.048
programming environment, so talk a
little bit about your work because you

522
00:36:21.048 --> 00:36:25.698
have developed a programming system
that is inclusive off blind and

523
00:36:25.698 --> 00:36:31.498
visually impaired children it's only
more so one of the observations that we

524
00:36:31.498 --> 00:36:36.218
made right away was that although you
could do some work to make some of the

525
00:36:36.228 --> 00:36:39.680
tools or ideas or development
environments accessible, some of the

526
00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.500
barriers that we saw students still
having we're with the languages

527
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:48.470
themselves and at the time we made this
sort of really innocent had this sort

528
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:54.210
of really innocent question, which was
why two languages have that design

529
00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:57.950
anyway and what was the evidence for
that decision? So for example, if you

530
00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:01.640
have a for loop in a language it's
entirely reasonable that that might be

531
00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:06.730
the case but why did they use the word
for and what was the evidence for that

532
00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:11.020
choice? Because it wasn't just one
person that that impacted right like

533
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:14.360
languages were used by millions of
people all over the world, so we might

534
00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:18.360
expect that you could just
hypothetically go to the programming

535
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.500
language designed literature, look it
up and figure out why they made certain

536
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.450
decisions and you're also thinking
about that case where you say a four

537
00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:32.110
loop is pronounced as for over brackett,
i've rested russian very known you're a

538
00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:35.740
bull or old double if you have to read
it by screaming, yeah, exactly so it

539
00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:39.750
wasn't so much that we thought for is
bad or some other word choices it's

540
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:42.770
just that we were sitting there
watching children like you know they're

541
00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:45.190
fourteen they barely know how to use
the computer they're just learning

542
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:51.230
programming for the first time and
they're like four left perrin into i

543
00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:54.810
and they're like, i have no idea what
this is trying to tell me and i just

544
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.630
made it obvious me like i wonder what
other words you could use

545
00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:02.150
maybe we can look it up but when we
looked up information the literature

546
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.820
there wasn't any evidence of these
things so we decided let's get some

547
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:09.710
ourself so we started running like
surveys and we started writing him at

548
00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:14.200
at larger scale we started running
statistical experiments comparing

549
00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:18.480
competing design choices for syntax and
i mean i'm sure it's not that

550
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.350
surprising but a lot of times you can
make stuff both orderly more

551
00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:25.270
understandable and more readable by
using common sense terminology and

552
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:28.850
getting rid of certain kinds of tokens
that you use the scientific method to

553
00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:35.280
derive so for example a lupin quorum is
repeat ten times so that the parameter

554
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:39.950
in a sense that then is in the middle
of keywords right which might be

555
00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:45.860
slightly unexpected for people that i
used to auto correct but there's also

556
00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.840
other options i think there's repeat
while and that works just like a while

557
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:52.790
but the key though is that you need
that were repeat because that's a hint

558
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:56.920
toe a novice that that's what that does
semantically so for example the word

559
00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.030
repeat implies the concept of
federation so when you look at the

560
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:03.920
statistics for how novices use those
tools if that words missing it's a

561
00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:08.200
problem so one of the changes i
understand it correctly that you made

562
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:13.700
your programming languages quorum is
the synth tax has to be such that words

563
00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:21.020
signifying meaning rather than being
weird words like four right and also a

564
00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:24.290
lot of the punctuation has to be vetted.
And the funny thing with those

565
00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:28.030
punctuation results is that something
that sometimes they're kind of odd so

566
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:31.860
like, for example, uh, this one
surprise me if you look at if

567
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.950
statements and you pull out the
statistics for if statements

568
00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:41.700
java or many languages use parentheses
on the sides and it turns out those are

569
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:46.430
likely to get screwed up, however you
you also get need to get rid of the

570
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:50.270
left brace, but not the right one,
which is sort of a bizarre decision. So

571
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:53.160
in corum you haven't if and then you
have an expression and then the word

572
00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:57.900
end so and it sounds sort of bizarre,
but if you leave that left one in, it

573
00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.870
turns out that the statistical
probability of novices getting that one

574
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:05.050
correct are pretty low, so you pull it
out and everything's fine. So instead

575
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:10.970
of if open brackets something something
close bracket you have if and then the

576
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:15.740
conditions and then end, right, and
then the other weird decision, but it

577
00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.860
turns out to be pretty impactful is a
few test you have this question of,

578
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:23.040
should i use the double equal sign or a
single equals or triple equals or

579
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.710
something like that? And it turns out
that answer is has a surprisingly large

580
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:32.930
effect size, so, for example if i use a
programming language like java, perl,

581
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:37.210
stuff like that and i compare, use a
double equal sign if i use a single

582
00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:40.640
equal, even if i use the same symbol
for assignment increases the

583
00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.846
probability of getting that token
correct by eightfold so it's way better

584
00:40:44.846 --> 00:40:50.126
to have let me summarize that an equal
sign for assignments, and also for

585
00:40:50.126 --> 00:40:54.716
comparison, oddly enough, we've we have
designed test cases where we used them

586
00:40:54.716 --> 00:40:58.336
both right next to each other, to try
to trick offices up, because the way

587
00:40:58.336 --> 00:41:01.696
we're thinking, if we're gonna overload
it, that's got a fella p up, turns out

588
00:41:01.696 --> 00:41:06.326
not, and is this just for blankets or
for all the cans, everybody, it used to

589
00:41:06.326 --> 00:41:09.926
be in corum that, like we were, we just
started with blind children, but now i

590
00:41:09.926 --> 00:41:14.536
think it's something like thirty six
thousand kids a year ballpark, so a lot

591
00:41:14.536 --> 00:41:18.426
more than we would have expected, so so
that road considerations fur sin,

592
00:41:18.426 --> 00:41:22.566
thanks how to make syntax more
inclusive, so that if you read it, it

593
00:41:22.566 --> 00:41:27.606
is easier to read, but also for other
kids is more inclusive. Does your

594
00:41:27.606 --> 00:41:32.576
programming environment also have? Are
you like features to specifically

595
00:41:32.576 --> 00:41:36.796
support blankets that other ideas your
programming tools don't have? Yes, so

596
00:41:36.806 --> 00:41:41.966
we've change the various features that
we have for the blind overtime so but

597
00:41:41.966 --> 00:41:45.366
some of them include additional
navigation features that we build into

598
00:41:45.366 --> 00:41:50.346
navigators and stuff like that we have
a self voicing option so sort of funny

599
00:41:50.356 --> 00:41:55.896
because screenwriters sometimes break
on certain platforms which is stinky

600
00:41:55.896 --> 00:42:00.446
but reality one of the things that we
allow people to do in our ideas

601
00:42:00.446 --> 00:42:03.926
basically turn off the default
accessibility support turn on just a

602
00:42:03.936 --> 00:42:08.926
different speech engine which people
don't like a cz much however it works

603
00:42:08.936 --> 00:42:12.276
everywhere and it's virtually
guaranteed toe actually talk and that

604
00:42:12.276 --> 00:42:15.686
speech engine is inside of your
programming platform pretty much yeah

605
00:42:16.016 --> 00:42:19.816
and it's not you know so this is a
thing oftentimes with accessibility if

606
00:42:19.816 --> 00:42:23.396
you get to eighty percent and it
actually works it's enough so in our

607
00:42:23.396 --> 00:42:27.126
case even though the tools that we had
weren't really perfect at the same time

608
00:42:27.126 --> 00:42:30.896
was enough to bring the number of
schools for the blind in united states

609
00:42:31.116 --> 00:42:35.216
that were teaching programming from
basically zero toe about half wow, that

610
00:42:35.216 --> 00:42:39.856
is impressive. So what are some
features that you consider to put into

611
00:42:39.856 --> 00:42:44.136
coram but didn't make the cut and for
what reasons in terms of like language

612
00:42:44.136 --> 00:42:49.174
features or heidi features or things
that maybe if we're programming we

613
00:42:49.174 --> 00:42:52.664
think oh, this is a good idea and you
tried it and it didn't work we want to

614
00:42:52.664 --> 00:42:57.954
hear about those okay sure so if you we
do a lot of experiments because

615
00:42:57.964 --> 00:43:01.304
normally form, we call it evidence
based on all that really means is that

616
00:43:01.434 --> 00:43:04.434
before we change the syntax and
semantics to the language and force

617
00:43:04.444 --> 00:43:08.594
every developer using it for every kid
using it to relearn it, we like we run

618
00:43:08.594 --> 00:43:13.114
a test and the test is usually put
people in a room have two people tried

619
00:43:13.114 --> 00:43:16.584
or fifty people tried one hundred
people try it and see what happens. If

620
00:43:16.584 --> 00:43:19.854
it turns out people do pretty well,
then it can go in the language, and if

621
00:43:19.854 --> 00:43:23.104
it turns out people don't do very well,
then we kind of let it fall by the

622
00:43:23.104 --> 00:43:27.364
wayside, so we tried a bunch of these
the one that's, the most common that

623
00:43:27.364 --> 00:43:31.244
has made it that is both in cornerman
has the strongest evidentiary support

624
00:43:31.244 --> 00:43:34.964
for it is static type icc sounds like a
silly thing it's, not like form, is the

625
00:43:34.964 --> 00:43:39.844
only language that has it, but the
evidence is extremely clear that static

626
00:43:39.844 --> 00:43:43.614
typing makes developers more productive.
If you're using a dynamically language,

627
00:43:43.624 --> 00:43:48.244
what happens is, as you go to call a
function, oftentimes developers don't

628
00:43:48.244 --> 00:43:51.464
know what to pass to the function, so
they go hunting for it, and it turns

629
00:43:51.464 --> 00:43:55.184
out in experiments that amount of time
where they're off hunting for what to

630
00:43:55.184 --> 00:43:58.714
pass to a dynamically type function.
Matches the time differences in the

631
00:43:58.714 --> 00:44:02.634
studies which means basically
observation aly we have evidence that

632
00:44:02.644 --> 00:44:07.794
dynamic typing makes perf programmers
slower than static typing this and this

633
00:44:07.794 --> 00:44:11.944
is for sided developers but i can
imagine the effect might be even bigger

634
00:44:11.944 --> 00:44:16.764
for blind developers because navigation
is such a babe big issue because for us

635
00:44:16.774 --> 00:44:21.024
just scrolling to function is just that
just screwing but if you're a blanket

636
00:44:21.024 --> 00:44:26.074
or blind professional developer the
navigation is is so big of a hurdle

637
00:44:26.084 --> 00:44:29.764
it's even worse i can imagine i've
actually never tested it with

638
00:44:29.764 --> 00:44:32.864
professional blind developers but i
would be very surprised if you were

639
00:44:32.864 --> 00:44:38.184
wrong i think you're right so this is a
nice example off something that is

640
00:44:38.194 --> 00:44:43.504
useful for everyone no just making it
inclusive for like developers but it's

641
00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:47.110
better for everyone so against the
language yeah i think so i think it

642
00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:51.020
goes both ways there's there's one
other that maybe maybe your listeners

643
00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:55.200
will be interested so the c plus plus
standard a few years back added lambda

644
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:58.950
is to the specifications and we were
curious whether or not that had a

645
00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:03.880
positive or negative impact so we ran
an empirical study in just comparing c

646
00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:08.230
plus plus lando's to it aerators which
is not the only test you would need to

647
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:12.260
make a determination but its starting
point oh it was also what apparently

648
00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:16.180
the spect writers in the original white
paper claimed it was for two hundred

649
00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:23.460
plays its traitors apparently so way
ran a test and we compared freshman in

650
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:27.550
college sophomores, juniors, seniors
and then professional developers that

651
00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:32.230
we recruited from experts in lamb jas
and we found that the experts had no

652
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:36.270
benefit at all and it basically crushed
all of the novices so it's one of these

653
00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:39.300
weird features where you know
developers put something in the

654
00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:43.970
language and maybe it has a benefit but
we found no evidence to that this is

655
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:49.130
interesting because people say, oh, i
like it because it has land us i mean i

656
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:54.380
would say that i shall it so nice is
that but you're saying if we measure if

657
00:45:54.380 --> 00:46:00.130
it helps it doesn't help professionals
and it herds kid's a novice is under

658
00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:03.910
the conditions of the test that we ran
yes and i don't think that land is

659
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:07.990
versus it aerators is sort of the end
of the story however we did sort of

660
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:11.560
just take it from what the developers
said so it's a starting point but it's

661
00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.530
possible there's other weird situations
where it might help like event driven

662
00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:18.550
programming your database or something
but those need to be verified through

663
00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:22.000
the scientific method to see if that's
actually true and i think you also

664
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.100
mentioned before not in the show but
when we were training before that land

665
00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:29.820
does are specifically hard to be
pronounced by screen reader because the

666
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:34.700
order is so different from an
incinerator oh, i don't remember saying

667
00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:38.040
that, but actually, that does make
sense, it's very plausible and there's

668
00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:42.090
sort of a weird, wacky syntax and has a
wacky scene. Yeah, and sometimes with

669
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:45.890
that wacky syntax, believe or not, this
especially hard for blind children,

670
00:46:46.075 --> 00:46:50.355
screeners don't always read literally,
so they skipped characters. What do

671
00:46:50.355 --> 00:46:54.035
they skip? It seems horrible, all sorts
of stuff, and when you think about it,

672
00:46:54.035 --> 00:46:57.335
that makes sense for, like microsoft
word, because you don't want a reading

673
00:46:57.335 --> 00:47:01.385
every period that would drive you
insane. So basically, what some blind

674
00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:04.055
farmers do is they turn on these
verbosity modes to make sure they hear

675
00:47:04.055 --> 00:47:07.275
everything, but if you're blind and
you're just starting out, you don't

676
00:47:07.275 --> 00:47:10.905
even know these things exist likely,
and if you have to turn on reading

677
00:47:10.905 --> 00:47:14.215
every character that it gets back to
annoying again. So it's sort of like

678
00:47:14.215 --> 00:47:19.315
this unfortunate sort of weird middle
ground with syntax where it's like you

679
00:47:19.315 --> 00:47:22.835
could do it, but it gets in the way.
Yeah, because some programming that was

680
00:47:22.835 --> 00:47:27.355
have adults for list access, and that
would be annoying if you would be skips.

681
00:47:27.685 --> 00:47:32.105
I think so. Do you also take that into
account in this insects of cora? So you

682
00:47:32.115 --> 00:47:35.785
you were like, oh, lesson old used old
speakers scream readers could but don't

683
00:47:35.865 --> 00:47:42.455
skip oh calm actually no because we
control the speech pipeline separately

684
00:47:42.515 --> 00:47:45.225
were very judicious about what
characters the screenwriter says

685
00:47:45.225 --> 00:47:49.535
because we control it yeah, but i think
you mentioned before that sometimes

686
00:47:49.535 --> 00:47:53.165
they use quorum with their bill in
screen reader and then maybe yeah, we

687
00:47:53.165 --> 00:47:57.935
cheat there too okay? Cheat yeah, you
overwrite it basically although we

688
00:47:57.935 --> 00:48:01.845
don't actually use dots to sort of one
of the weird quirky things about form

689
00:48:01.845 --> 00:48:08.345
syntax that came from data but my only
annoys me we found evidence that the

690
00:48:08.355 --> 00:48:12.555
dot operator isn't the operator you
should use for objects for whatever

691
00:48:12.555 --> 00:48:16.755
reason surveys on it at scale show the
colon operator makes more sense to

692
00:48:16.755 --> 00:48:21.265
human beings sort of drove me crazy
enough that i ran a replication study

693
00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:24.435
at a different university in a
different part of the country just to

694
00:48:24.435 --> 00:48:27.015
try to prove it wrong, but
unfortunately it replicated with

695
00:48:27.015 --> 00:48:30.885
tremendous precision. So you're saying
we shouldn't use dole's for object

696
00:48:30.885 --> 00:48:36.755
access oddly, which everyone does yes
almost it's annoying but one's aaron

697
00:48:36.765 --> 00:48:40.245
very good no, i've never seen it. In
fact, we kind of put it in there is a

698
00:48:40.255 --> 00:48:43.325
junk character we didn't think would
win the study, but you know, i don't

699
00:48:43.325 --> 00:48:47.597
get to choose these things that's
interesting sort of bizarre i'm not

700
00:48:47.597 --> 00:48:52.127
even exactly i have a guess, but i'm
not entirely sure i even observe that

701
00:48:52.127 --> 00:48:55.757
result like for example, maybe dot just
implies like the end of a sentence or

702
00:48:55.757 --> 00:49:00.427
something or maybe colin implies some
kind of connected listers i'm not

703
00:49:00.427 --> 00:49:04.567
really sure but you know we did it we
got the answer we replicated it got the

704
00:49:04.567 --> 00:49:08.697
same answer me whales do you d'oh
interesting okay, but the fact that the

705
00:49:08.697 --> 00:49:12.937
readers read a character or or don't
read character isn't what influence the

706
00:49:12.937 --> 00:49:17.247
syntax everything you put into forum is
there because you tried it with people

707
00:49:17.247 --> 00:49:20.947
and you measured a result not for
everything. When we first started the

708
00:49:20.947 --> 00:49:24.787
project, we were just working with kids
and so think about it like this the

709
00:49:24.787 --> 00:49:28.637
very first version of corn we made a
bunch of decisions and not all of them

710
00:49:28.637 --> 00:49:32.707
were evidence based because that didn't
exist it wasn't beginning exactly and

711
00:49:32.707 --> 00:49:35.867
there was no such thing as an evidence
oriented language that that did not

712
00:49:35.867 --> 00:49:40.167
exist, so but we found we figured out
really quickly that we needed some

713
00:49:40.167 --> 00:49:44.027
evidence tto make it better. So then
what we did is every time we made a

714
00:49:44.037 --> 00:49:48.087
change to the language, we started
adjusting it over time, but there are a

715
00:49:48.087 --> 00:49:51.587
few decisions and corum that air left
that we haven't run a study on yet that

716
00:49:51.587 --> 00:49:55.247
i think probably get invalidated hope
one of them is we have this sort of

717
00:49:55.587 --> 00:49:59.667
wacky multiple inheritance system it's
not like c plus plus is it's sort of

718
00:49:59.667 --> 00:50:04.057
it's this own thing but it would not
surprise me if some day we get a study

719
00:50:04.057 --> 00:50:07.517
together that it could be invalidated
but we try to do that that's sort of

720
00:50:07.517 --> 00:50:12.397
our goal is to sow is to run tests to
invalidate our own choices to make them

721
00:50:12.397 --> 00:50:19.187
better over time so an interesting
question there is ardor cool flits or

722
00:50:19.187 --> 00:50:23.907
tension between the use for a
programming language for blind

723
00:50:23.917 --> 00:50:29.377
professional developers to use for
learning blind in offices or cited in

724
00:50:29.377 --> 00:50:36.417
offices or learning adult developers
mean you say we tested it on people

725
00:50:37.217 --> 00:50:42.247
maybe some features are really great
for professional developers that

726
00:50:42.257 --> 00:50:45.307
shouldn't be in the language foreign
offices i mean this is a little bit

727
00:50:45.307 --> 00:50:49.299
like that example you gave land us for
experts they don't matter before kids

728
00:50:49.299 --> 00:50:54.869
they really matter so are you arguing
for one language that's perfect for

729
00:50:54.869 --> 00:51:00.269
everyone or to do taylor a language
that specifically for blind no emphasis

730
00:51:00.459 --> 00:51:04.129
and another language that has land lies
and all the bells and whistles for

731
00:51:04.129 --> 00:51:08.059
professionals what is best there? I
think that that's a great question and

732
00:51:08.059 --> 00:51:11.379
i think that even the academic
community doesn't really know and

733
00:51:11.389 --> 00:51:16.229
there's a really good reason it turns
out that between like the fifties until

734
00:51:16.229 --> 00:51:20.809
about two thousand twelve if you take a
reasonable chunk of the academic

735
00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:24.079
literature in computer science on
programming languages they didn't

736
00:51:24.079 --> 00:51:27.489
actually test with people so we don't
have a consensus, and i say they didn't

737
00:51:27.489 --> 00:51:33.309
test, i mean, almost overwhelmingly,
universally did not test specifically

738
00:51:33.309 --> 00:51:39.589
there's, a scholar by the name of anti
hani donahoe, and he discovered that

739
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:43.139
during that period on ly, about twenty
two controlled experiments were

740
00:51:43.139 --> 00:51:48.729
conducted, and the thing is that's just
not enough for us to really know. Now,

741
00:51:48.799 --> 00:51:52.619
to be more of a more direct answer, we
do have evidence, like you say, though,

742
00:51:52.839 --> 00:51:56.219
that there are some features that might
be in conflict between novices, um,

743
00:51:56.219 --> 00:52:00.529
professionals, one of them is, again
static typing. It turns out most of the

744
00:52:00.529 --> 00:52:03.479
studies and replications that we've
done or somewhere in the ballpark of,

745
00:52:03.479 --> 00:52:06.989
like yours, three of an academic
program up through, like beginning

746
00:52:06.989 --> 00:52:11.069
professional, so we don't really have
much good information passed that, and

747
00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:14.279
we don't have much good information
about, like children or children with

748
00:52:14.289 --> 00:52:18.069
disabilities or children with, you know,
men, women, all these different kinds

749
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:22.369
of groups, and i think if we really
want to flesh out whether or not we can

750
00:52:22.369 --> 00:52:25.269
make languages that find a good middle
ground for everybody, we're going to be

751
00:52:25.279 --> 00:52:29.659
a heck of a lot more data from but not
just for me from like, on entire

752
00:52:29.669 --> 00:52:33.529
academic community, otherwise we
probably won't get there. Yes so in

753
00:52:33.529 --> 00:52:38.089
general would you say that not just for
our language let's zoom out a bit again

754
00:52:38.139 --> 00:52:42.519
so tools aps websites and programming
environments should they have a

755
00:52:42.519 --> 00:52:47.329
specific version for the visually
impaired on a special version for

756
00:52:47.339 --> 00:52:51.682
sighted people like you have an english
version in the spanish version and you

757
00:52:51.682 --> 00:52:54.502
get the medicine the same with all
these programmers should there be an

758
00:52:54.502 --> 00:52:57.962
office programming experience and
something val producers or should it

759
00:52:57.972 --> 00:53:02.552
will be the same what is your take on
that specialize or generalized my vote

760
00:53:02.552 --> 00:53:05.932
is for generalized and you know i don't
have a crystal ball so i can't know for

761
00:53:05.932 --> 00:53:09.902
sure but here's my reasoning when it
comes to the first question which is

762
00:53:09.902 --> 00:53:14.462
specialized for the blind or not that
one i would give a hard no and the

763
00:53:14.462 --> 00:53:17.852
reason is because sometimes when
there's tools that are developed just

764
00:53:17.852 --> 00:53:21.412
for the blind they don't get maintained
as well because you know a company

765
00:53:21.412 --> 00:53:24.912
might make more money off the one
that's general purpose than not so

766
00:53:24.922 --> 00:53:28.912
that's one reason why at least i don't
know how it is where you're from but in

767
00:53:28.912 --> 00:53:31.662
the united states well that's one
reason why they make laws about making

768
00:53:31.662 --> 00:53:35.132
general technology accessible because
they don't want like amazon to make

769
00:53:35.132 --> 00:53:40.052
like the blind reader that they
maintain once and then don't support

770
00:53:40.062 --> 00:53:45.122
for fifty years yeah yeah okay you but
that is a practical argument or maybe a

771
00:53:45.132 --> 00:53:49.542
capitalist arguments it's not a
philosophical argument about what is

772
00:53:49.572 --> 00:53:54.682
past talk about no dural as it is now,
but the world i was we will i'd like it

773
00:53:54.682 --> 00:54:00.422
to be do you think a specific app for
your website for visually impaired that

774
00:54:00.422 --> 00:54:04.552
maybe mrs um features that's? Why did
developers would like is that better

775
00:54:04.562 --> 00:54:08.772
journals suppose we have the money to
maintain when everyone okay, that's a

776
00:54:08.772 --> 00:54:14.882
fair point? I i still think i prefer
the generalist, though, and the reason

777
00:54:14.882 --> 00:54:19.402
is because a lot of the type of stuff
that i was taken i d that i d does are

778
00:54:19.402 --> 00:54:22.052
things like buttons and lists and trees
and stuff, and those were actually

779
00:54:22.052 --> 00:54:26.562
pretty accessible if it's there. So i
do think that you can make specialized

780
00:54:26.562 --> 00:54:29.412
features in ieds that would be
accessible. That would be better,

781
00:54:29.412 --> 00:54:33.392
though, so for example, i do suspect
you'd want to specialize the bugger

782
00:54:33.812 --> 00:54:37.472
because right now most debugging
technologies don't talk and there are

783
00:54:37.482 --> 00:54:41.602
known i've invented some talking to
buggers over the years. How cool yeah,

784
00:54:41.602 --> 00:54:44.282
they're they're pretty fun, they like
tell you like what variables were doing

785
00:54:44.282 --> 00:54:47.442
and stuff like that they're pretty neat
the current version that we have the

786
00:54:47.452 --> 00:54:50.482
attacking the buggers not great, but
i'm hoping to build some new ones in

787
00:54:50.482 --> 00:54:54.582
the some new projects and so i'm still
curious about that talking the bugger

788
00:54:54.856 --> 00:54:58.516
how does it work and why isn't that
great? But what are you going to add

789
00:54:58.526 --> 00:55:02.106
that s oh it's a little bit harder to
build it on top of, like the j v m,

790
00:55:02.106 --> 00:55:05.366
javascript and other languages, which
is what cornum compiles to a bunch of

791
00:55:05.366 --> 00:55:09.806
different places. So during my
dissertation, working like the mid to

792
00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:15.556
thousands or so which makes me feel old
now, okay, way had, like an interpreted

793
00:55:15.566 --> 00:55:20.646
version of sea that were playing around
with and if you contract information

794
00:55:20.646 --> 00:55:23.306
about the state of a program and a
little bit better way, you could make

795
00:55:23.446 --> 00:55:26.466
the buggers say all sorts of cool stuff,
like saying what kind of methods are

796
00:55:26.466 --> 00:55:30.576
being called as you navigate instead of,
like what line you're on, say, oh, hey,

797
00:55:30.576 --> 00:55:34.606
the variable a was set to five, and so
you could give people context about

798
00:55:34.606 --> 00:55:38.596
what's changing in a program. Of course,
the challenges are like, what context

799
00:55:38.596 --> 00:55:44.616
you give? Yeah, so let's ask it
probably does so the stuff that we did

800
00:55:44.616 --> 00:55:47.716
was relatively primitive. We would just
kind of tell you the most obvious thing

801
00:55:47.716 --> 00:55:51.316
like, hey, this method was called or
hey, this variable changed, but

802
00:55:51.316 --> 00:55:55.346
nonetheless, even with just those
changes, the studies that we ran were

803
00:55:55.346 --> 00:55:58.916
pretty obviously clear that is better
than saying you're online five, you

804
00:55:58.916 --> 00:56:03.046
know which is kind of obvious but
nonetheless like simple little things

805
00:56:03.046 --> 00:56:06.706
can sometimes make a big difference for
accessibility, but and they're just not

806
00:56:06.716 --> 00:56:09.636
enquire meant this point for technical
reasons and all because you don't

807
00:56:09.636 --> 00:56:13.206
believe they work well the second the
butter yes, they kind of go in and out

808
00:56:13.206 --> 00:56:17.516
with every releases we experiment so
sometimes way are building a new

809
00:56:17.516 --> 00:56:20.366
versions will pull something out for a
while and are the bugger right now is

810
00:56:20.366 --> 00:56:25.326
okay, but it's nothing super special,
so i can imagine these type of features

811
00:56:25.336 --> 00:56:30.946
like at the burger that talks aren't
just useful for visually impaired

812
00:56:30.956 --> 00:56:35.426
people but also for sighted people. Can
you give a few examples off

813
00:56:35.506 --> 00:56:39.456
accessibility features in general not
just in ideas but also an absolute

814
00:56:39.456 --> 00:56:44.696
websites that are designed for visually
impaired people but also can be useful

815
00:56:44.696 --> 00:56:48.476
for sighted people? I think i might
have already mentioned this one, but

816
00:56:48.486 --> 00:56:53.446
probably the most obvious and easy to
understand one is color contrast moves

817
00:56:53.486 --> 00:56:59.932
yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, so ah lot of
the times the features that people use

818
00:56:59.932 --> 00:57:04.632
with accessibility can actually also be
used by people without disabilities and

819
00:57:04.632 --> 00:57:08.922
one obvious one that that blind people
use heavily and so decided people is

820
00:57:08.922 --> 00:57:12.352
keyboard shortcuts and think about it
some about some of the people that i've

821
00:57:12.352 --> 00:57:16.542
known over the years that are blind
don't have a monitor or a mouse way

822
00:57:16.542 --> 00:57:20.682
needed by what they needed exactly and
so, like you generally navigate like

823
00:57:20.682 --> 00:57:24.382
crazy with the keyboard so if you're
writing an app and you make tons of

824
00:57:24.382 --> 00:57:27.582
awesome keyboard shortcuts and waste a
knave a grant around of the keyboard

825
00:57:27.662 --> 00:57:30.652
and you're an expert users you'll
probably like that anyway but blind

826
00:57:30.652 --> 00:57:34.782
people will love you forever yes it's
some features you met me you might make

827
00:57:34.782 --> 00:57:38.082
that you might even make them for
expert usual sure like yeah, all the

828
00:57:38.082 --> 00:57:41.912
shortcuts and then they're useful for
blind people but also the other way

829
00:57:41.922 --> 00:57:45.032
right? Yeah exactly or just make him
for you because like you might love

830
00:57:45.032 --> 00:57:49.212
those things and have them extra and
then blind are crazy about keeper shirt

831
00:57:49.222 --> 00:57:51.692
yeah that's the thing right including
myself so

832
00:57:52.752 --> 00:57:56.462
i'm most curious in the other way
around are their accessibility features

833
00:57:56.472 --> 00:58:01.672
that you can put into a tool a rupture
your app that might hamper so your

834
00:58:01.682 --> 00:58:06.152
people that we sighted people would be
like ways that there that is confusing

835
00:58:06.152 --> 00:58:09.152
me it's not helpful? Is that a thing or
is that not?

836
00:58:10.292 --> 00:58:14.982
Um yeah, probably i mean the you know
it's really easy is a developer to make

837
00:58:14.982 --> 00:58:18.462
a boo boo and make something hard to
understand so a lot of the same things

838
00:58:18.462 --> 00:58:22.292
like you know if you're content is
written in a funny way or your

839
00:58:22.302 --> 00:58:23.092
interface

840
00:58:24.342 --> 00:58:30.122
has weird color contrasts in it or the
buttons air aligned in strange ways or

841
00:58:30.582 --> 00:58:34.652
ah good one might be tab order like for
a sighted person that's using the

842
00:58:34.652 --> 00:58:37.652
keyboard shortcuts that they have weird
tab orders so that you're flying around

843
00:58:37.652 --> 00:58:41.152
the interface in a funny way for a
sighted person that's going to be odd,

844
00:58:41.252 --> 00:58:44.942
you know, like imagine like a form
where it jumps to the wrong spots as

845
00:58:44.942 --> 00:58:49.892
you press tab right for you and i that
because i'm a sighted person too. That

846
00:58:49.892 --> 00:58:54.672
would be really annoying for a blind
person who drive them bonkers. So so we

847
00:58:54.672 --> 00:59:01.082
can be xer debated by no being able to
see exactly cool. Those are all things

848
00:59:01.082 --> 00:59:05.832
we can take into going toe when making
stuff for blind people but also making

849
00:59:05.832 --> 00:59:10.092
it accessible for other people. That
was everything i wanted to ask. Is

850
00:59:10.092 --> 00:59:14.622
there anything you want to add anything
we missed? No, i think that you have a

851
00:59:14.622 --> 00:59:18.772
lot of questions that i appreciate a
whole lot of made me actually think

852
00:59:18.772 --> 00:59:22.602
about it who's gonna want to make our
guests thing to make her audience. I

853
00:59:22.602 --> 00:59:26.342
think we just want to ask you one more
thing if that's okay, if we want to

854
00:59:26.372 --> 00:59:30.092
know more about you, your programming
language, the cool stuff you're doing,

855
00:59:30.102 --> 00:59:34.572
what is your website when we re more
about you well, i think in google,

856
00:59:34.572 --> 00:59:38.592
andrea steph iq and my university
website is up and i'll send you a link,

857
00:59:38.602 --> 00:59:42.412
but if you want to read more about
forum, you go to korean language dot

858
00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:45.412
com, you want to read more about
evidence, there's a nice little link

859
00:59:45.412 --> 00:59:48.812
right on the fun, and it'll give you a
bunch of little details about how this

860
00:59:48.822 --> 00:59:51.872
evidence thing kind of works cool.
We'll make sure all of those are in the

861
00:59:51.872 --> 00:59:56.732
show showing a school. Thank you for
