00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:04.189
Our company has a new strategic
initiative to increase market

2
00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:09.309
penetration, maximise brand loyalty and
enhance intangible assets in pursuit of

3
00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:14.469
these objectives we start a new project
for to require seven red lines i

4
00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.609
understand your company can help us in
this matter. Of course water here will

5
00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:24.299
be the project manager water we can do
this come way yes, of course anderson

6
00:00:24.299 --> 00:00:27.369
here is our expert in all matters
related the drawing red lines we've

7
00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.519
brought him along today to share his
professional opinion nice to meet you

8
00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.859
well you all know me this is justine,
our company's design specialist hello

9
00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:41.029
we need you to draw seven red lines all
of them strictly perpendicular some

10
00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:44.359
with green ink and some of transparent
can you do that?

11
00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.109
No i'm afraid that's not russian any
hasty answers anderson the task has

12
00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.059
been said it needs to be carried out at
the end of the day you are an expert

13
00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:57.559
the term redline implies the color of
the line to be read to draw a red line

14
00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:01.789
with green ink is well it's not exactly
impossible it's pretty close to being

15
00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.199
impossible what does that even mean?
Impossible? I mean it is possible there

16
00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:09.659
some people say suffering from color
blindness for whom the colored lines

17
00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.939
doesn't really make a difference but
i'm quite sure that the target audience

18
00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.009
of your project doesn't consist solely
of such people is invincible this is

19
00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:17.559
possible

20
00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:24.399
i'll simplify line as such can be drawn
with absolutely any ink, but if you

21
00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.559
want to get a red line you need to use
ready

22
00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:32.479
what if we draw them with blue? It
could it still won't work if you use

23
00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.159
blue ink, you'll get two lines

24
00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.649
and what exactly did you mean when you
talked about the transparent? How to

25
00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:41.259
explain

26
00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:47.919
i'm sure you know what transparent
means yes and what a red line means i

27
00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:52.959
hope i don't need to explain to you
what you need to draw red line

28
00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:58.719
with transparent ing you described what
you imagined the end result would look

29
00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.100
like come on and see what we got
kindergarden way let's not waste our

30
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.200
time with these unproductive quarrels
the task has been set the task is plain

31
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.810
and clear now if you have any specific
questions then go ahead. You'll get

32
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:12.280
that here.

33
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.060
Oh right let's leave aside the color
for the moment you had something there

34
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.310
also relating to perpendicular pretty
seven lines all strictly perpendicular

35
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.780
to what

36
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.870
two everything amongst themselves. I
seemed you know what happens if your

37
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.740
lines alive because he does he's an
expert two lines can be perpendicular.

38
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.180
All seven can be simultaneously
perpendicular to each other.

39
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.880
I'll show you

40
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:54.280
this is a line, right? Yes, and another
is it perpendicular to the first line?

41
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.460
Well

42
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.370
yes, it is perpendicular exactly wait,
wait i'm not done and a third one is it

43
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.880
perpendicular to the first line?

44
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.040
Yes, it is but it doesn't cross the
second line they're both parallel

45
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.480
not perpendicular

46
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.880
i suppose so there it is two lines can
can i have a pen?

47
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.280
How about this?

48
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:55.330
This is a triangle it's definitely not
perpendicular lines and their three not

49
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.720
seven

50
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.170
why they blew andy don't trust that
myself i have a blue pen with me this

51
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.600
was just a demonstrates the problem
your lines simple who draw them with

52
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.110
reading it wants off the problem how do
you know before you've tried it that's

53
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.600
drawing with reddick then let's see, i
don't have a red pen with me but i'm

54
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.970
completely certain that with reading
the result will still be the same. But

55
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.950
didn't you tell us earlier that you
could only draw red lines with red ink

56
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.010
if it gets written that down here and
now you want to draw with blue nick, do

57
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.000
you want us to call these red lines? I
understand you know you're not talking

58
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.370
about the color now, right? You're
talking about that what you call a perp

59
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:42.330
in dick dick think temerity yes that's
it now you've confused everyone so what

60
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.190
exactly is stopping us from doing this
geometry? Just ignore it we have a tusk

61
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.430
seven red lines it's not twenty is just
seven anderson i understand you're a

62
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.800
specialist of a narrow field you don't
see the overall picture but surely it's

63
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.830
not a difficult task to draw some seven
line exactly suggest a solution that

64
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.970
any fool can criticize no offense but
you're an expert and you should know

65
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.750
better okay

66
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.800
let me draw you too perfectly
perpendicular red lines and i will draw

67
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.260
the rest with transparent ink they'll
be invisible but i'll draw them would

68
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.950
deceive us

69
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.720
yes this will do just yes, but at least
a couple with greeting oh, i have

70
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.400
another question if i may can you draw
one of the lines in the form of a

71
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.830
kitten but in the form of a kitten
market research tells us our users like

72
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.150
cute animals it would be really great
if you know why look, i can of course

73
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.110
draw you a cat no artist but i can give
it a try but it won't be a line anymore

74
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.070
it will be a cat, a line and a cat
these are two different things

75
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:58.790
not a cat with a kitten a little cute
cuddly cats on the other hand what

76
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.785
anderson at least hear her out she
hasn't even finished speaking and you

77
00:06:02.785 --> 00:06:07.655
already saying no i got the idea but
it's impossible to draw a line in the

78
00:06:07.655 --> 00:06:08.485
form of a cat

79
00:06:09.985 --> 00:06:11.395
what about a bird

80
00:06:15.525 --> 00:06:19.975
so where do we stop what we're doing?
Seven red lines or two with red ink to

81
00:06:19.975 --> 00:06:22.745
with green ink in the rest with
transparent that understand correctly?

82
00:06:22.755 --> 00:06:27.025
Yes, excellent, in which case that's
everything right, i almost forgot. We

83
00:06:27.035 --> 00:06:30.595
also have a red moon. Do you know if
you could inflate it?

84
00:06:34.985 --> 00:06:39.945
What do i have to do with balloons?
It's anderson, can you or can you not

85
00:06:39.945 --> 00:06:44.255
do this? A simple question, it's. Such
a can, of course, but excellent.

86
00:06:44.375 --> 00:06:50.195
Organize a business trip will cover the
expenses, go over to their location,

87
00:06:51.005 --> 00:06:54.995
inflate the balloon well, this is very
productive. Thank you all.

88
00:07:08.285 --> 00:07:12.975
Can i ask you one more question, please.
When you inflate the balloon, could you

89
00:07:12.975 --> 00:07:14.395
do it in the form of a kitten?

90
00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:21.395
Of course i can. I can't do anything i
can do absolutely anything

91
00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:24.885
i'm in expert.
